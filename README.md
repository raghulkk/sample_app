  I learned ruby on rails frameworks and i used SAMPLE APP for practice to create basic rails app with model, controller and views

  steps i used to create sample app

  * create rails new sample_app

  * Then i create few models 

            * user 
            * doctor and patient 
            * post and comment ..etc

  * creating column and records in tables by using migration in database

  * makes link between two tables by associations like one to one , one to many and many  to many

          MANY TO MANY ASSOCIATION

          Eg : 1) user has many doctors through doctor_users
               2) doctor has many user through doctor_users
               3) doctor_users belongs to user and doctor

  * created controllers for users, doctors etc

  * after that moves to fix a url in routes with http methods and respective controllers and actions

  * In a particular controller write a respective logics in actions(methods)

  * after finshing controller logics i was create api or write a html code in particular view

  * At last basic app is created...
